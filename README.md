# Barrel_Shift_Register

The Barrel Shift Register mainly shift the bits of specific number by specific count and in specific direction (Left / Right) and can be the replacement of universal shift register as well,

I have designed the BSR using behavioral modelling using XILINX VIVADO, the direction for the model is both left and right and count is randomly between the range of [1-7]
